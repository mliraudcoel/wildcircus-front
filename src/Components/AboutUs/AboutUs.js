    <h3>The birth of Wild Circus</h3>
    <p className="description">It was in a cold night of december, in 1985, that a clown named Barry, from the planet of "Happyface", accidently fell on earth. His spatialship hit a seagull, and because the spatialship was in marshmallow, the seagull started to eat the spatialship... Poor Barry. He was the feet in the mud, near his spatialship almost totally eaten, and he was desperate. When he looked around him, all that he saw was sad people, walking in line like zombies, not even seeing that he was here. He was however the only in colour! All people was in black, with sadness on their faces.
    So Barry decided to stay on earth and to create a circus, like his circus on "Happyface", in order to give smile on the humans' faces.
    That was the birth of "Wild Circus"!
